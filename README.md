# Important!

I'm currently reworking this app to get it up and running again since the Spotify API requires auth tokens.

# Before Using..

1. Make sure you have Node.js and Node Package Manager(npm) installed

2. Run `npm i` in the command line

# About This App

This app allows users to search for an artist by keyword, then browse different artists by grabbing a randomly selected but related artist.

Users can also choose whether they want a more mainstream artist, or a more underground one. 

Note that some artists may not even have related mainstream or underground artists (like Bruno Mars, for example).

# For The Future..

This project was completed in a time crunch, so for the future, I plan to re-vamp the CSS, add some animations - mainly tweak the UI, possibly add more functionality, and give it a snappy title.

This app was created as a response to a code challenge as part of an interview for a certain company. Hope you enjoy, guys! ;)
